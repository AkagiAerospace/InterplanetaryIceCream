		default = Where's the Ice Cream?  There isn't any here.
		MinmusLandedSrf = For the first time since you've landed here, you don't feel hungry.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Eating ice cream while looking at the relaxing spectacle of Mintmus' terrain is the best.
		MinmusInSpace = The ice cream seems sad to leave Mintmus.
		MinmusInSpace = The ice cream seems happy to leave Mintmus!
		//GillyLandedSrf = You wonder why all this ice cream seams so heavy in your stomach, even in there's the local gravity.
		//GillyInSpaceLow = So you're eating ice cream in space while doing nothing?  Kerbonaut must be a really good job!
		//GillyInSpace = Gilly looks like a giant ice cream.
		PolLandedSrf = So this is pollen ice cream...  Very tasty, what flavor is it? Tulip, rose perhaps?
		PolInSpaceLow = As the ice cream from Pol enters your body, you start to cough like if you had hay fever.
		PolInSpace = The ice cream seems bored.
		BopLandedSrf = Hmm, bopolate ice cream. Delicious.
		BopInSpaceLow = You're suddenly afraid that this ice cream has part of the Kraken's soul embodied in it.  That's no time for Rapid Unplanned Disassembly!
